Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow (IBM)

Run the following commands in your terminal to run notebooks: 

git clone https://github.com/sinisabubonja/coursera-building-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow.git \
python3 -m venv final \
cd final \
source bin/activate \
pip3 install -r requirements.txt \
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=Python4TF \
jupyter notebook 

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows you (among other things) to select which notebook to open. In the Notebook Dashboard, navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell at a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
